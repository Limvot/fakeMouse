fakeMouse
=========

Program that fakes mouse movement and events, intended to be used as a stop gap for LEAP and other 3D interaction tools.

It needs the Leap daemon installed and running. (Can get from the Linux SDK download on developer.leapmotion.com/)
Also, edit the CMakeLists.txt to correct the path to the SDK.
THen use cmaek to set up your build system and build!

Just running the program should then work. It will take control of the cursor. Try running it in a terminal so that you can press enter to quit.
